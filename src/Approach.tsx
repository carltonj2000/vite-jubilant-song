      As for Black Velvet Canyon, turn north off Highway 160 onto a dirt road,
      4.6 miles west of the intersection with Highway 159. Take the obvious left
      turn BEFORE the left turn that leads to Black Velvet. Continue down this
      road, turning right at a distinctive 4-way intersection. Drive as close to
      the canyon as you are comfortable. From the parking area, hike west into
      the canyon, following burro trails where possible and cross-country where
      not. Stay on the north (right) side of the wash, aiming for a notch
      up-canyon on the right side. The trail becomes more distinct up a steep
      hillside towards this notch, left of an deep canyon. March up this steep
      section to a flat area known as the Football Field. From here the
      southface of Windy Peak is obvious. Hike on up a couple hundred more feet
      to the base of the face. See photo. The approach is considered strenuous,
      and will take an hour or more.
