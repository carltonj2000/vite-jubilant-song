        pitch to a ledge with a bush.
      </li>
      <li>
        (P2) Continue up the crack into a wide chimney full of loose blocks,
        belay where possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        (P3) Continue up and right and find a belay below the left side of the
        huge roof.
      </li>
      <li>
        (P4) Traverse right under the roof, belaying in a small corner with huge
        loose blocks.
      </li>
      <li>
        (P5) Surmount the roof (5.8) and continue up easier ground for a short
        distance to belay in a gully.
      </li>
      <li>
        (P6) Continue into the gully, do some chimney moves, then move right
        into a water streak. Balancy moves past a bolt lead to easier ground,
        step left to a bush to belay.
      </li>
      <li>
        (P7) Step back right into the water streak, and continue up difficult
        5.8 moves onto easier ground. Climb a corner to a belay notch.
      </li>
      <li>
        (P8) A 5th class move leads to 4th class slab and the summit of Windy
        Peak
